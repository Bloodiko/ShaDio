Shadow Audio. 

== Abandoned ==
Reason: 
    This was supposed to work with Ubuntu, but i cannot get the chromium (electron) to record from pulseaudio system monitor. 
    If i cannot get audio, the whole purpose cannot be fulfilled.

Record Desktop Audio, keep 5 minutes in cache. 

Hokey similar to "Screenshot" tool. 

Records application audio passivly in a buffer. When pressing a predefined hotkey, the buffer will be saved into a file. Eventually buffer can be cutted to explicitly only save selected content from buffer.
